                                                            AppXManager is a Windows optimization tool designed to streamline system performance by managing system applications (AppX packages). It allows users to easily uninstall unwanted system apps, all through an intuitive interface. The project focuses on making system customization accessible and efficient.



Windows installations often include many pre-installed applications and services that users may not need. These can take up disk space, consume system resources, and compromise privacy. 

AppXManager simplifies the process of identifying and removing these unnecessary components, providing:

Faster system performance.
Increased free storage space.
Improved user control over system behavior.
Enhanced privacy through disabling telemetry and tracking.
